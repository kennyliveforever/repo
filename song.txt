Did you miss me?
Did you miss me when I weren't around?
Take a second to comprehend this
Air it out like dark matter, preach about the new meta
All the things that we did, that we said, it was all in my head
Will it ever get better?
So tell me, do you like the taste?
Do you like the taste? Lost in this head space
It's on loop like everyday, call me your saving grace
Killing time with the band, understand it was all in our heads
It'll only get better
So tell me, did you miss me when I weren't around?
Twisted perceptions, weaved into new dimensions
Like a brotherhood, I knew that we'd pull through
You've all been branded by the four three two crew
Go

Did I lose my mind?
Fell out of orbit like a satellite
Came crashing down without a sound
But I'll still light up the night sky
One last time
Can you save me? Can you save me?
Or I'll hit the ground
Fell out of orbit right before it all came crashing down
Did you miss me when I weren't around?
Did I lose my mind?
Fell out of orbit like a satellite
Came crashing down without a sound
But I'll still light up the night sky
One last time
One last time
